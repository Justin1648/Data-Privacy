Data Privacy Policy

I am an individual, building Home Automation Apps for private use.  Amazon is making me create an OAuth 2.0 account, and forcing me to post a link to my data privacy policy.  Here is my Policy:

1. I don't want your data
2. I don't want to share your data
3. I don't want to read your data
4. I don't want to store your data
5. If this ever turns into anything, I will see about hiring a lawyer and creating a real data policy.

If you are using this, you probably know me personally in which case I really don't want to share your data.  I swear on a good bottle of bourbon I will not do anything that will intentionally give your data to anyone other than Amazon because they run the Alexa system which will use the skill I am trying to build.
